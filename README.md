# Authentication-System

This an full Stack authentication system it is an completely working registring and login a user system . 
It is made with MERN stack and I have also used bycrpt for hashing the password so nobody can access anything also used JWT (JSON Web Token) if we are using multiple pages so we don't have to login again and again to access our content.
I have made multiple users in it so whenever we register a new user is created and when we do login we can see the new user on the dashboard with all the existing users .

If you want to use this register and login pages install the following dependencies:-

BACKEND :-

npm init
npm i express mongoose cors bcrypt dotenv jsonwebtoken

FRONTEND :-

npm create vite@latest
npm react-router-dom axios 

also integrate tailwind css with it
